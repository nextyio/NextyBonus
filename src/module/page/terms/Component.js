                    <p>Nexty&rsquo;s smart contract (the &ldquo;smart contract&rdquo; or &ldquo;software&rdquo;) is the software deployed and running on the decentralized distributed Nexty blockchain (the &ldquo;platform&rdquo;).</p>
                    <p>A third-party platform is a resource that allows transferring tokens to its users.</p>
                    <p>Originally, this software was developed and deployed by Nexty (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Our&rdquo;).</p>
                    <p>Nexty coins (the &ldquo;NTY&rdquo;) are part of the Software and ensure its interaction with the Network.</p>
                    <p>By using a smart contract, including its tokens, You expressly acknowledge and represent that You (the &ldquo;User&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Your&rdquo;) have carefully reviewed and accepted this Agreement between You as a User and the Company.</p>
                    <p>The offer is a public offer.</p>
